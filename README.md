# Monorepo

This is the first time I'm creating a monorepo. Just wanted to test it out with some svelte exploration on the side:)

## Structure

- `/apps` contains all the apps. Currently there is only one app; `svelte`
- `/packages` contains all the packages for this repository. Currently there is only a ui library which the `svelte` app uses. These packages are only used locally in this project
